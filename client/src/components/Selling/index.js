            Rossed bark is when the course outer bark is removed leaving only the inner bark for sale.

                We do buy many others on an individual basis, depending on quantity and species available.

                Example: Maypop is in demand but it must come from a certain region and must be available in large quantities (500+) per shipment.

                If you can supply a sizeable amount (25+) of an item not listed, please contact us for pricing.

                If you have located a plant and are not sure if it is valuable, please submit a sample for our inspection and we will offer our advice on harvesting.
